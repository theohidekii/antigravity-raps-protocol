# Antigravity R.A.P.S. Protocol 

> A configuration framework for transforming AI coding assistants into Senior Staff Engineers.

## Overview

This repository contains the system prompts, workflows, and configuration rules designed to optimize **Google Antigravity** (and similar advanced AI agents) for high-level software development and automation.

The configuration follows the **R.A.P.S.** methodology, shifting the AI from a simple code generator to a comprehensive system architect.

## The R.A.P.S. Framework

This setup is built on four pillars:

* **R - Rules:** Strict global and project-level guidelines ensuring code quality and consistency.
* **A - Armory:** Integration of MCPs (Model Context Protocols) like **Firecrawl** (Web), **Supabase** (Data), and **Pinecone** (Memory).
* **P - Parallel Agents:** distinct personas for distinct phases (@Designer, @Builder, @Researcher, @Nerd).
* **S - Serverless:** Architecture focused on scalable, serverless automation (Modal/Next.js).

## Installation

1.  Open your Antigravity/AI Agent settings.
2.  Navigate to **Global Rules** or **System Instructions**.
3.  Copy the content of `global-rules.md` from this repository.
4.  Paste it into your settings.

## Usage

Once configured, you can invoke specific agents within your chat:

* *"@Designer, please refactor this component to match the glassmorphism style."*
* *"@Nerd, audit this API route for security vulnerabilities."*

## Credits & Inspiration

This configuration was heavily inspired by the insights of **Jack Roberts**.
